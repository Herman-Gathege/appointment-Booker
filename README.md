Purpose of Each File
app.js
Main server-side file that configures Express, routes, and middleware.
Handles form submissions and temporarily stores appointment entries.

Tracks metadata about the project.

package-lock.json
Locks versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installations.

views/appointment.ejs

What the Code Does
App Initialization (app.js)
Sets up a basic Express server.
Configures middleware to parse incoming form data and serve static files.
Uses EJS as the templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages.
Appointment Booking
The form collects user details such as name, contact information, preferred service, and date/time.
The POST endpoint /book-appointment processes the form data and stores it temporarily.
Displays error messages if form validation fails (e.g., empty fields, invalid date, or double booking).
Appointment Display
Displays a list of existing appointments using EJS templates.
If no appointments are booked, a message indicating that is displayed.
Layout (layout.ejs)
The layout.ejs file provides a common structure for all pages in the app. It includes reusable elements such as:
The <head> section for meta tags and links to CSS styles.
A header section for site navigation or branding.
A footer section for additional links or information.
Styling
Custom styles are applied using the styles.css file in the public directory to enhance the user experience.
